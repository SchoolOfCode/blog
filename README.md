This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I created this project inspired by an interview with FitWith. A social media platform for fitness enthusiastic. It is currently at MVP stage

## Stack used:

I used NextJs to set up this app. I also used Prisma to set up a postgresSQL and to make CRUD requests. The app is currently populated with the postgresSQL data. I used Tailwind CSS to style the react component and make them responsive. 

## Deploy on Vercel

The site is deployed on Vercel.
